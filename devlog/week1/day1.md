**Devlog — Fastify + TypeScript**

Today i learned about fastify and its basics.The syntax felt okay. I learned why @types/node was used in typescript
- @types/node is required so that typescript gets an idea on what these functions are, what are its input and output etc(eg:fs,buffer,process)
- Without this, typescript will never be able to know the concepts of node 

I came to understand exactly the contents used in tsconfig.json. Eventhough i knew what tsconfig.json was, it was a vague information and i wasnt sure on exactly what each of it does.

I have also learned about pino, which is a logger that gives out information about pid,hostnames,what level means(severity of the log)
